CaptainBern's Reflection Framework
================================

This is a Java-Reflection and Bytecode Engineering library.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to work with Reflection on both a high and low level.

The Bytecode Engineering Lib (as for now "JBEL") can be used for Class-analysis and to create dynamic code on runtime.

One can also use it to, as example, parse a class, visit it with the build in visitor-api and dissemble the class.

(Please note that the bytecode library is a "toy" created by a 16-year old to learn a little more about bytecode and the java programming language, you have been warned)

The reflection framework was originally created to easily set and get fields and to invoke methods and constructors easier.

Content
=======

The Reflection framework is located in the `Reflection` folder and the Bytecode-library is located in the `JBEL` folder. That wasn't hard at all, was it?

Contributing
============

Prerequisites:

* When contributing to JBEL you need to have a basic understanding of bytecode.
    * Spelling errors and grammar fixes don't require this so feel free to PR a fix for those.
* Some code contains basic documentation, some doesn't contain any documentation at all. Feel free to expand the documentation and please always document the code you add.
* Keep the side-notes in mind. When you notice a weird piece of code that doesn't make any sense to you, then please check if it has a side-note, if it has one then that will probably make clear what is happening there.

Everyone can contribute code to their liking. When making PR's please provide a brief description of what your code does, how it works and why it should be pulled.

* I generally follow the Sun/Oracle coding conventions
* Feel free to ignore the "80 column limit"
* Curly braces should always be on the same line. (with one space in between)
* Make sure your code works
* When adding new classes please make sure you've added the license text above the class's package declaration.
* If you even consider contributing; Thanks!
