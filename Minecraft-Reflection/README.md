Minecraft-Reflection
====================
This library contains several utility classes to "safely" access the Minecraft server
internals on a CraftBukkit based server.

It is heavily based off the tools included in ProtocolLib so most of the code will look familiar for
the people who have used ProtocolLib before. ProtocolLib's license can be found [here](proto-license.txt)
